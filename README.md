# Container for Xilinx Vivado

Docker for Xilinx Vivado IDE development environment.  

## Requirements

Ensure the following before proceeding:
- Download the `FPGAs_AdaptiveSoCs_Unified_*_Lin64.bin` file.
- A Xilinx account (typically free) is required to install the packages and provide login credentials.
- Have `docker` installed.  

## Preparation

Download the installer from the official page.  
```
$ mkdir ./download
$ cp <Downloads>/FPGAs_AdaptiveSoCs_Unified_*_Lin64.bin ./download
```

Check if UID and GID are in your environment. If not, set them accordingly.
```
$ export UID=$(id -u)
$ export GID=$(id -g)
```

Provide Xilinx user credentials as env vars.
```
$ export XILINXMAIL=my.email@company.com
$ export XILINXLOGIN='password123'
```

Note: `XILINXMAIL` and `XILINXLOGIN` are required only during container creation and are not stored inside the container.  

You can either edit the `install_config.txt` file or use it as-is with a given default. This file serves as the Xilinx installation configuration.  

After the image is built, the download folder can be deleted. The Xilinx installer .bin file, located in `./docker/build_context`, can also be safely removed.  

## Build

```
$ ./setup.sh
```

Initially call to setup.sh to setup a mounted folder workspace (if not already around), it will return without giving a prompt.
```
$ ./setup.sh

    Preparing docker images - please re-run this script to enter the container image!
    setting up workspace
    READY.
```

## Usage

```
$ ./setup.sh
    setting environment
    ...

xilinx<20:15:21>::lrub("~/");
(docker)$ vivado &
    ...
```
end a container session  
```
(docker)$ exit
$
```
A folder _workspace_ is mounted into the docker container. Content in the _workspace_ folder thus persists when exiting the container.  
## Troubleshooting

remove the container entirely
```
$ docker images
